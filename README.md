## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best answer I have for this question is test early and test often.  The more
testing that is involved, the more you can be assured that the code is functional
and secure.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

When interpreting user needs, I like to take the need and refine it into a function.
By asking how a need should be met, and then continually asking how to do that
you can refine the need into concrete requirements.  Then you can code a solution
that successfully fulfills a users needs, and is testable.

## How do I approach desigining software?

I think that the answer to this is integrally tied to the ansewr to the last
question.  My approach is to capture the high level need.  The 10,000 mile view 
of the problem.  Then, continually refine the problem, and design.  Continually
revise the solution, filling in all the missing information until you are left
with a working approach.
